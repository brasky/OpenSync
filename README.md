# OpenSync

## Overview 

OpenSync is a free, open source, and cross platform site for synchronizing the playback of YouTube videos. It is currently in early development but is completely functional. It is available online at https://opensync.live or you can clone the source and run it like you would any dotnet core application, see [self-hosting](#self-hosting).


## Self-Hosting

You'll need the following to host OpenSync:

- .NET Core >= 3.0
- [A Google API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

Once you have your API key, set it as an environment variable called `googleapikey` and that's it!
