# Contributing

Any contribution is more than welcome and there are a variety of ways to contribute. The point of OpenSync is to be an easy place to watch videos with friends and part of that is being able to add the features you need easily.

## Creating an Issue

One of the simplest ways to contribute is to submit an issue. Issues most commonly take one of two forms:

### Bugs

If you have found a bug, please provide things such as:

- Were you the leader of the room?
- What was the URL of the video you were trying to play? 
- What happened? What do you think should have happened? Screenshots are appreciated.

### Enhancements

Enhancements are any new feature or modification of an existing feature that isn't a bug. If you want to turn a page pink, that is an enhancement. Feel free to just post suggestions and they will be worked on as people see fit. 

If you want help creating a proof of concept or implementing the idea, ask for help in the issue. Otherwise you can also [submit a PR](#Creating-a-Pull-Request)


## Creating a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request create an issue explaining what you're changing/adding/fixing, then associate your PR with the issue. Try to keep PRs as small as possible to accomplish the goal in the issue (i.e. try to solve 1 problem or add 1 feature per pull request).
